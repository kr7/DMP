# Exam

As you know, in the exam, you are expected to present your own miniproject. This is followed by a short session of questions that you are expected to answer. 
Question may refer to your miniproject or to **anything** that has been discussed in the course. Nevertheless, there is a list of example questions (that is:
there is no guarantee that you will get question from this list, but the questions in this list are intended to be similar to the questions
that will be asked in the exam):

1. What is data mining?
2. What is machine learning?
3. What is the difference between machine learning and data mining?
4. Give a few examples for typical data mining tasks!
5. Give a few examples for typical data mining applications!
6. What are the major phases of data mining projects?
7. What is the major difference between waterfall and agile project methodologies?
8. When is data preprocessing necessary? Give a few examples for typical data preprocessing tasks!
9. What is classification?
10. Give some example of classification tasks!
11. Name a few software libraries/frameworks that may be used to solve classification tasks!
12. What is clustering?
13. Give an example for outlier detection!
14. What is regression?
15. What is supervised machine learning?
16. What is unsupervised machine learning?
17. Show an example of decision tree and explain how it works!
18. When it come to the evaluation of machine learning algorithms, what is the most important to pay attention to?

Please note that the above questions may be asked in many different ways, or rather: many different versions of these questions may be asked. For example, instead of question "When it come to the evaluation of machine learning algorithms, what is the most important to pay attention to?", 
one could ask, for example:
(a) "Why is it important to split the data into training and test data?", 
(b) "What is the most important when you split the data into training and test subsets?",
(c) "Is it a good idea to evaluate your model on all the available data?",
(d) "Is it a problem if training and test data overlap?"
(e) "What is overfitting? Give an example to illustrate it!"
and so on...
